# PiHole-Finder
This is a software application to find the gateway and Pi-Hole Ad Blocker on your network.

Pi-Hole is a Raspberry Pi Ad Blocker for your network. <br />

Currently their project requires the user establish a static IP on the Pi.<br />

My twist on this concept is to allow a Pi-Hole to dynamically get an address, then use the PiHole-Finder software application to resolve the gateway and Pi-Hole IP. With this information, the user can then fire up their web browser and configure the Pi-Hole via a web interface.<br />

So, the workflow is:<br />
1. Install Raspian.<br />
2. Run the Pi-Hole Installation script.<br />
3. Run the PiHole software application.<br />
